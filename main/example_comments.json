As long as he doesn&#x27;t cash out $400k a year he never pays that 20%, and he shouldn&#x27;t need to ever. You also need to subtract IPO price from current price. Which is about going to drop those estimates about 35%. It still a big chunk of change, no doubt, but I have no problem with getting around it by going to charities.
